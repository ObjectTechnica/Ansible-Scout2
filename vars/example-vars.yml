# Use variables with Ansble Vault
# To create a new encrypted data file, run the following command:
# ansible-vault create foo.yml
#
# To edit an encrypted file in place, use the ansible-vault edit command. 
# ansible-vault edit foo.yml
#
# If you have existing files that you wish to encrypt, use the ansible-vault encrypt command.
# ansible-vault encrypt foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml
#
# If you have existing files that you no longer want to keep encrypted, you can permanently decrypt them by running the ansible-vault decrypt command.
# ansible-vault decrypt foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml
#
# If you want to view the contents of an encrypted file without editing it, you can use the ansible-vault view command:
# ansible-vault view foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml
